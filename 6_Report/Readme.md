# Requirements

## Introduction

* The purpose of the project is to control a servo motor using Atmega328 microcontroller. This simple motor control when turned on can rotate the servo motor.

## Components Used

1. A switch
2. AVR Atmega 328 Microcontroller
3. Voltage source
4. Servo Motor

## Software Used

1. SimulIDE
2. Microchip Studio

## Cost and Feature

The cost of the hardware and software design is fixed and one-time investment only.

This device can rotate a servo motor.

## SWOT Analysis

### Strength

1. The ultimate strength of servo motors is its innovative and user-friendly.
2. Servo motors are used in many robotics operations.

### Weaknesses

1. It is restricted to one operations.
2. Always power supply is needed for the motor to perform an operation.

### Opportunities

1. We can use it for a typical motor use.

### Threats

1. This project only deals with turning ON and OFF the servo motor.


## 4W's and 1H

### Why

1. To turn ON and OFF the servo motor.
2. To rotate the motor.

### Where

1. Servo motor can be used in many areas.

### Who

1. Those who want to do a manual operation.

### When

1. Anyone who have to rotate a sensor or hand.

### How

1. By turning ON and OFF the motor.
